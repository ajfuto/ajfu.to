### Reverting changes

If you simply want to revert your changes to the most recent commit:
```console
git reset --hard
```

To remove files that are untracked, we'll use `git clean`.

---

### Dry run

`git clean` has a **dry run** option (`-n`) where we can preview any changes that would be made. 
```console
git clean -n
```
This shows any files in the *current directory* that would be deleted. `git clean` avoids recursing into further directories by default. To recurse into other folders, use the `-d` option.
```console
git clean -nd
```

---

### Let's go!

To actually clean the files, use `-f`.
```console
git clean -f
```
Again, this removes files in your current directory. To remove files recursively in subdirectories, use `-d`.
```console
git clean -fd
```

To clean files that are ignored (i.e., they're in `.gitignore`), use `-x`
```console
git clean -fx
```

For an interactive experience, use `-i`. This can also be paired with `-d`.
```console
git clean -id
```

---

### Summary
- use `-n` to preview any changes that may be made
- use `-d` to recurse into subdirectories
- to actually delete, use `-i` for an interactive experience or use `-f` to force
